 BDMUSORT -  Sorts the outputs from one or more invocations of the
             BDMGTUID program to produce a sorted list of Userids
             with all duplicates removed.  This list of Userids is
             capable of being fed to the BDMULOAD program, so these
             Userids can be Bulk Loaded into a new BRODCAST Dataset.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  BDMUSORT will LINK to your SORT program, sort all inputted Userids
  (8-characters) and will afterwards delete duplicate entries.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  All the following DD names are required !!!
  --- --- --------- -- ----- --- --------

  USERIDS, USRIDOUT, SORTIN, SORTOUT, SYSOUT, SYSPRINT

 If any of these DD Names is missing, see the Error Handling section
 below.

USERIDS  - This is the input concatenation of files of Userids,
           usually created by the BDMGTUID program from one or
           more BRODCAST Datasets.  (LRECL=8)

      Sample JCL definition for the USERIDS concatenation.

  //USERIDS  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.USROUT
  //         DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.SYS1.USROUT
  //         DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.SYS2.USROUT


USRIDOUT - This is the output, sorted, Userid file (LRECL=8) with
           all duplicate Userids deleted.  Suitable for input to the
           BDMULOAD program.

  //USRIDOUT DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.USRSORT


SORTIN, SORTOUT - These are work files needed by the external SORT
           program which is LINKed to by BDMUSORT.

      Sample JCL definitions:

  //SORTIN   DD  DSN=&&SORT,DISP=(NEW,PASS),UNIT=SYSALLDA,
  //             DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=8,BLKSIZE=8000),
  //             SPACE=(TRK,(5,5))
  //SORTOUT  DD  DSN=&&SORT,DISP=(SHR,PASS),VOL=REF=*.SORTIN


SYSOUT   - A SYSOUT DD name which displays the output of the external
           SORT utility program.


SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the report showing
           everything that was done in the post-sorting process.

 ---   BDMUSORT   ---   Userid Sort and Delete Duplicates ---


    Total Userids Read Into Program :       3856
    Total Userids Read Out from Sort:       3856

    Total Userids Without Duplicates:       3855


Program Logic
------- -----

  Concatenated files of 8-character records are read into an
ascending external sort, and the output of the sort is read back
into the program.  Duplicate records are then deleted, and all
non-duplicates are written to the 8-character USRIDOUT output
file.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  DD Name Protection
  -- ---- ----------

  ALL of the following DD Names must be present:

   USERIDS, USRIDOUT, SORTIN, SORTOUT, SYSOUT, SYSPRINT

    Diagnosis:

  All DD Names must be present, otherwise a "write to the JES LOG"
  is written that a DD Name is missing, and the Return Code is 16.

  A "write to the JES LOG" is always written with a Diagnosis
  message.  If there are no errors, the following appears:

  BDMUS01I     DDNFLAG = 3F     *  Correct  *
  IEF142I SBGOLOBC BDMUSORT - STEP WAS EXECUTED - COND CODE 0000

  If incorrect, something like the following appears instead:

  BDMUS01I     DDNFLAG = 36     * diagnosis *
