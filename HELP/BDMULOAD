 BDMULOAD -  Loads a BRODCAST Dataset, which does not have any
             Userids in it yet, with a complete set of new Userids
             from a list.  The list must be in a format, LRECL=8,
             RECFM=FB, such as that produced by the BDMGTUID program,
             followed by the BDMUSORT program.  These are 7-character
             Userids with the 8th character being a blank.  The list
             of new Userids to be loaded is in the BDMUSIN DD Name.

             If Userids are already present in the BRODCAST Dataset
             which the BDMULOAD program is attempting to load (with
             new Userids from the BDMUSIN DD Name), then no loading
             is done, a Return Code of 4 is sent, and the BDMUSOUT DD
             name gets filled with a dump of all the Userid names (in
             BDMGTUID format) that are already present in BRODCAST.
             If the UIDPRES DD Name is also there, then a detail
             report of the (already) loaded Userids is produced.  If
             the BDMUSIN DD Name is missing, then Diagnostic Reports
             are produced in SYSPRINT and (if there) UIDPRES DD
             Names, telling whether the BRODCAST DD already contains
             Userids, and (in UIDPRES) what they are.

             If you want to add a few new Userids to the BRODCAST
             Dataset that already has Userids in it, use the BDMUSADD
             TSO program, which you can run under TSO-in-batch, to
             add them individually.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  BDMULOAD will accept Userids from the BDMUSIN DD name, and will
  reject the loading of these Userids into the BRODCAST Dataset if
  there already are ANY real Userids loaded in the BRODCAST Dataset.

  If the target BRODCAST Dataset already contains some Userids, then
  BDMULOAD will dump them (in BDMGTUID format) into the BDMUSOUT DD
  Name, and (if the UIDPRES DD Name is there) it will report detailed
  information about these Userids in the UIDPRES sysout report.  A
  Return Code of 4 is produced, when Userids are already loaded in
  the target BRODCAST Dataset.

  The reason for this behavior, is to make it easier to reload the
  (already loaded) Userids later, into a truly empty (of Userids)
  BRODCAST Dataset.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  The following DD names are Required !!!
  --- --------- -- ----- --- --------

  BRODCAST, SYSPRINT, BDMUSOUT

 If any of these DD Names is missing, see the Error Handling section
 below.

 If you are loading a BRODCAST Dataset that is empty of Userids, then

  BDMUSIN is also a necessary DD Name.

  The following DD name is Optional
  --- --------- -- ---- -- --------

  UIDPRES    (See Note at bottom of "Error Handling" section below)


BRODCAST - This is the BRODCAST Dataset which is to be loaded
           with new Userids.

      Sample JCL definition for the USERIDS concatenation.

  //BRODCAST DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.BRODCAST


SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the Summary Report
           telling you about the Userid loading process.

BDMUSOUT - A new file in RECFM=FB, LRECL=8 format which will contain
           all Userids already in the BRODCAST Dataset (in BDMGTUID
           format).  If the load of the BDMUSIN Userids was
           successful, then this dataset is empty, after the BDMULOAD
           run.  If there previously were Userids loaded in BRODCAST,
           then those Userids are now dumped into this dataset.

BDMUSIN  - A file in RECFM=FB, LRECL=8 format which contains all the
           Userids to be loaded into the BRODCAST Dataset.

  //BDMUSIN  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.USERIDS


UIDPRES  - A SYSOUT DD name which contains a detailed report showing
           all the Userids that were already in the BRODCAST Dataset
           if it had any.  If the BRODCAST Dataset did not have any
           Userids loaded previously, and the current load was
           successful, then the UIDPRES report will not show any
           Userids listed, as follows:

  DD Name Protection
  -- ---- ----------

  If any of the following required DD Names are missing :

   BRODCAST, SYSPRINT, or BDMUSOUT

then the BDMULOAD program ends with a Return Code of 16, and
produces the following output to the JES LOG, depending on
which of the required DD Names were missing:

  BDMUL01I     DDNFLAG = 06     * diagnosis *
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL10E     BRODCAST DD Name is missing...
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL10E     BDMUSOUT DD Name is missing...
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL10E     SYSPRINT DD Name is missing...
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL00I     ----------------------------
  BDMUL09E     Please correct your JCL.......

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  If the BDMUSIN DD Name is missing:

then a message is issued saying that no Userids will be loaded because
there is no input, and a Diagnostic Report only will be produced.
Also, a message is always sent to the JOB LOG as follows:

     BDMUL01I     DDNFLAG = 1D     *  - OK -   *
     BDMUL00I     ------------------------------
     BDMUL07I     //BDMUSIN DD input is needed.
     BDMUL06I     Reports are for Diagnosis only
     BDMUL00I     ------------------------------

  There are two possible cases:

1.  There are no Userids yet loaded into this BRODCAST Dataset.  So
    the resulting SYSPRINT report will say:

 ---   BDMULOAD PROGRAM  -  Broadcast Master  Version   1.5.0A   ---
 Copyright (c) 1995-2025 Sam Golob Systems Programming LLC - All Rights Reserved
         -  BDMULOAD Program  -  Userid Bulk Loader Program  -

    Diagnostic Report Only - No BDMUSIN was present.


    Total # of Userids Present in BRODCAST DSNAME          0
    Total # of Empty Slots in Brodcast available:       4005

    BDMUSID was not present, so Userids were not loaded.

2.  There are Userids already loaded into this BRODCAST Dataset.  So
    the resulting SYSPRINT report will now say:

 ---   BDMULOAD PROGRAM  -  Broadcast Master  Version   1.5.0A   ---
 Copyright (c) 1995-2025 Sam Golob Systems Programming LLC - All Rights Reserved
         -  BDMULOAD Program  -  Userid Bulk Loader Program  -

    Diagnostic Report Only - No BDMUSIN was present.


    Total # of Userids Present in BRODCAST DSNAME       3855
    Total # of Empty Slots in Brodcast available:       4005

    Real userids are in BRODCAST. Cannot load new ones.

And in either case, a Return Code of 4 is produced.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

IMPORTANT NOTE:

  If the UIDPRES DD Name is PRESENT, then:
         -------            -------

1.  Where Userids have not yet, been loaded, the UIDPRES will NOT
    show any Userid names.

2.  Where Userids have already been loaded or are in the BRODCAST
    Dataset already, then all the Userids in BRODCAST will appear
    in the UIDPRES report, and they will also be dumped into the
    BDMUSOUT dataset.

A Return Code of 4 is produced in both of these cases.
