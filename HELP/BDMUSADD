 BDMUSADD -  Add a single new Userid to the BRODCAST Dataset.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----


Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMUSADD program is used to add one Userid to the BRODCAST
Dataset, if it doesn't exist there already.

  This is how the operation works.  The Userid records in the
BRODCAST Dataset are scanned sequentially from the beginning to
the end.  Two things are looked for:

1.  The first empty Userid-Slot combination.  This is recorded.

2.  The occurrence of a duplicate Userid, already in the BRODCAST
    dataset.

  If there is no duplicate Userid, but there is an empty slot, then
BDMUSADD adds the new Userid into the empty slot.

  If there is a duplicate Userid, then BDMUSADD reports this fact,
and exits.

  If there is no duplicate Userid, and no empty slot, then BDMUSADD
looks for an empty User Message Record, key X'FF', converts it into
a Userid Record, key X'01', chains the new Userid Record to the old
Userid Records, and adds the new Userid into its first slot.

  If there is no duplicate Userid, and there are no empty User Message
Records left in the BRODCAST Dataset, then BDMUSADD reports the error
condition and exits.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMUSADD program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMUSADD program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMUSADD as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:
-----------
            INSTRUCTIONS FOR BDMUSADD TSO COMMAND
            ------------ --- -------- --- -------

      BDMUSADD userid               - Add this Userid to the
                                      BRODCAST Dataset


Report:
------

  Here is what you see if BDMUSADD is adding a Userid USR1247 to
  the BRODCAST Dataset:

 BDMUSADD PROGRAM  -  Broadcast Master  Version   1.5.0A
 Copyright (c) 1995-2025 Sam Golob Systems Programming LLC - All Rights Reserved

        USERID USR1247 WAS ADDED IN RECORD 0002B2  SLOT 03


Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were explained above,
in the "Description of Operation" section.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  If no Userid name is added after the BDMUSADD command, the following
message is issued:

 PLEASE ENTER THE USERID NAME AFTER COMMAND NAME

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the Userid name entered after the command name, is already a
Userid in this copy of the BRODCAST Dataset, then the following
message is issued:

 THIS USERID USR1247 ALREADY EXISTS IN BROADCAST

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMUSADD issues
the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        BAD OPEN - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU
