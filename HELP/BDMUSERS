 BDMUSERS -  List all Userids having outstanding User Messages.

             Show all defined Userids in the BRODCAST Dataset.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMUSERS program is used to LIST all Userids having
outstanding User Messages attached to them.  A second function is
the BDMUSERS A(LL) listing, which shows all Userids defined in the
BRODCAST Dataset, and the location of their Userid record slots,
within the BRODCAST Dataset.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMUSERS program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMUSERS program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMUSERS as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:
-----------

---------------------------------------------------------------

  The BDMUSERS program is the basic utility in the Broadcast Master
Package, which will show you which Userids have outstanding User
Messages attached to them.  It is used as follows:

            INSTRUCTIONS FOR BDMUSERS TSO COMMAND
            ------------ --- ------ --- -------

      BDMUSERS               - List all Userids having outstanding
                               User Messages attached to them, and
                               how many messages for each Userid.

      BDMUSERS A             - List all Userids defined to the
      BDMUSERS ALL             BRODCAST Dataset, with special
                               listings for those Userids with
                               User Messages attached to them.

a BRODCAST Dataset that is full of messages and defined Userids:

---------------------------------------------------------------


Program Logic:
------- -----

  Basically, the BDMUSERS program runs through all the Userid Records
in the BRODCAST Dataset, but instead of displaying the messages
themselves, it merely counts them, if outstanding User Messages exist
for a given Userid.

  If you don't say A or ALL as a parameter to the BDMUSERS command,
then the program completely ignores the display of Userids that don't
have any outstanding messages attached to them.

  If you do say A or ALL as a second parameter to BDMUSERS, then EVERY
Userid, including those without attached messages, is displayed.  Any
Userids WITH attached messages, get the counts of the messages, and
an additional display of the starting and ending RBA addresses for the
first and last message attached to them.

  See the sample reports shown above, and you'll get the idea.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMUSERS issues
the following message:
