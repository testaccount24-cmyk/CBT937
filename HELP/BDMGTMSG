 BDMGTMSG -  Extract all User Messages, chained to all Userids,
             from an existing BRODCAST Dataset.  The messages
             are dumped into a sequential fixed-blocked (RECFM=FB)
             dataset, with each Userid's messages separated by
             separator records in a form resembling IEBUPDTE
             separator cards.  Messages from the BDMMDUMP dataset
             are intended to be reloaded quickly into a newly
             created BRODCAST Dataset by the BDMMLOAD Bulk Message
             Reloader program.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  BDMGTMSG dumps all Userid Messages to a sequential output dataset.
These messages can be quickly reloaded into a new BRODCAST Dataset
by the BDMMLOAD Bulk Message Reloader program.

  BDMGTMSG runs all Userid chains for all Userids in the BRODCAST
Dataset which contain messages.  For each Userid, a header record
is written to the output (the BDMMDUMP) dataset, and then the
combined key+data (FB-130 sequential format) for each message
follows, until all the messages for that Userid are exhausted.
Then the next Userid's messages are dumped, until all messages are
dumped for all Userids.

  Format of the Header Record :

./--- IBMUSER

starting in Column 1.

  Messages from the BDMMDUMP output dataset are intended to be
reloaded into a new BRODCAST Dataset, using the Bulk Message Loader
program, BDMMLOAD.  See the Help member for BDMMLOAD to get
additional information.

  BDMMLOAD is a very quick message reloader.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  The BDMGTMSG program is a relatively simple program that extracts
all User Messages from a BRODCAST Dataset.

  Required DD names -

BRODCAST - This is the BRODCAST Dataset whose messages are being
           dumped.

      Sample JCL definition for the BRODCAST dataset.

  //BRODCAST DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.BRODCAST

BDMMDUMP - This is the FB-130 dataset that contains the dumped
           records from BRODCAST.

      Sample JCL definition for BRODDUMP DD name.

  //BDMMDUMP DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
  //            DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.MSGDUMP,
  //            DCB=(LRECL=130,BLKSIZE=27950,DSORG=PS),
  //            SPACE=(TRK,(15,45),RLSE),
  //            UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=WORK04

SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the report showing
           all the Userids which had messages dumped, and how
           many messages each of the Userids had.  This report
           resembles BDMSCAN's BRODMAP report, in its appearance.

Program Logic
------- -----

  The BDMGTMSG program runs all Userid Message chains for all
Userids in a BRODCAST Dataset which have outstanding messages
attached to them.  The message key and data are combined into a
sequential record, and dumped using QSAM into a sequential output
dataset.  Each Userid's messages are separated from the next
Userid's messages, using a Header Record of the form:

./--- userid

where the userid is a 7-character field.

  Messages from the BDMMDUMP output dataset are intended to be reloaded
into a new BRODCAST Dataset, using the Bulk Message Loader program,
BDMMLOAD.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  The existence of each required DD name in the JCL is verified
using a TIOT scan at the beginning of BDMGTMSG program execution.
If a required DD name is missing, then the program issues an error
message, and does not rely on the operating system to do so.

  In the case that the BDMMDUMP DD name was coded, and other DD
names were not coded, then the dataset pointed to by the BDMMDUMP
will not be created properly, and therefore it will have to be
deleted manually before the job is rerun.  Error messages tell
you what to do, as follows:

   Cases:
   -----

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

SYSPRINT DD Name is missing:  In this case, there is no SYSPRINT to
   write messages to, so the BDMGTMSG program writes the messages to
   the JOB LOG, depending on whether BDMMDUMP DD was correctly coded
   or not.  IF BDMMDUMP was correctly coded, it is not written to,
   but it was allocated.  Therefore it must be deleted before the
   job can be correctly rerun.  JOB LOG messages as follows:

 BDMGM00I     ----------------------------
 BDMGM10E     SYSPRINT DD Name is missing...
 BDMGM00I     ----------------------------
 BDMGM03E     BDMMDUMP not created properly.
 BDMGM02E     Delete BDMMDUMP and rerun job.
 BDMGM00I     ----------------------------

   A Return Code of 16 is issued (because of the severity of not
      having SYSPRINT to write to).

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

BDMMDUMP DD Name is missing:  In this case, the BDMMDUMP DD has not
   been allocated, so therefore it does not have to be deleted.
   So a message is written to SYSPRINT as follows:

 BDMGM01E   ---  BDMMDUMP DD Name Missing  ---

 BDMGM05E   ***  Please correct your JCL   ***

   A Return Code of 12 is issued.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

BRODCAST DD Name is missing:  It depends on whether BDMMDUMP
   was also coded, and therefore BDMMDUMP will then have to be
   deleted before the job can be correctly rerun.  If BDMMDUMP
   is present and coded, then the following is displayed:

 BDMGM01E   ---  BRODCAST DD Name Missing  ---
 BDMGM03E   ---  BDMMDUMP not created properly..
 BDMGM02E   ---  Delete BDMMDUMP and Rerun ---

 BDMGM05E   ***  Please correct your JCL   ***

   If the BDMMDUMP DD is also missing, then the following is
   displayed:

 BDMGM01E   ---  BDMMDUMP DD Name Missing  ---
 BDMGM01E   ---  BRODCAST DD Name Missing  ---

 BDMGM05E   ***  Please correct your JCL   ***

   A Return Code of 12 is issued.
