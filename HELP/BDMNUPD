 BDMNUPD  -  Turn on the Bit in the TSO Vector Table Control
             Block which tells TSO that the Incore copy of the
             Global Notices must be updated.  Before TSO/E
             Release 3, only OPER SEND'  ',SAVE or DELETE would
             read this bit and update the table.  With TSO/E
             Release 3 (z/OS 1.3 and later), LISTBC interrogates
             this bit and updates the table.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----       ****  Must be APF Authorized  ****

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMNUPD program runs the appropriate control blocks and turns
on the appropriate bit.  In order to do this, the command must be
APF Authorized, and it must be in the IKJEFTE2 table, or in the
Authorized TSO command section of the PARMLIB IKJTSOxx member which
is currently active.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  None.


Subcommands:   none

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The purpose of the BDMNUPD program is to force an
 update to the Incore Notices Table which LISTBC reads.
 The need for update is signalled by the TSVTNCTU bit
 in the TSO Vector Table, mapped by macro IKJTSVT.
 Once the TSVTNCTU bit has been set, it depends which
 TSO release you have, as to what program will interro-
 gate the bit, and update the Incore Notices Table.
      -  The TSVTNCTU bit has now been set  -
 At TSO/E Release 3 and above, running LISTBC alone
 will create a new Incore Notices Table.
 Below TSO/E Release 3, you have to do an
  OPER SEND ' ',SAVE first.
 This means that z/OS 1.2 and below, will require the
  OPER SEND ' ',SAVE.
 And z/OS 1.3 and above, only requires that someone
  somewhere in the system, will execute LISTBC, which
  means that all that is necessary is that someone will
  LOGON to a TSO session.
 This release of TSO/E is:  3.08.0 .

Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were mentioned above,
in the "Description of Operation" section, and in the Sample Report.

Error Handling:
----- --------

  If the BDMNUPD load module is not running APF Authorized, then the
following message is issued:

BDMNUPD  PROGRAM - Broadcast Master  Version   1.5.0A

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TSVTNCTU bit has not been set because APF authorization is needed.
