 BDMMLOAD -  Bulk User Message Loader program.  BDMMLOAD is intended
             to very quickly load User Messages dumped from another
             BRODCAST Dataset by the BDMGTMSG program, into a newly
             initialized BRODCAST Dataset that was created with the
             BDMINIT program.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  BDMMLOAD is a very quick message reloader.  The speed is achieved
  by means of thorough pre-analysis of the BDMMDUMP dataset, and of
  the BRODCAST Dataset where the messages will be loaded.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  Required DD names -
  -------- -- -----

BRODCAST - This is the BRODCAST Dataset whose Userids are being
           dumped.

      Sample JCL definition for the BRODCAST dataset.

  //BRODCAST DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.BRODCAST

BDMMDUMP - This is the dump of all messages from the old BRODCAST
           Dataset, which was produced by the BDMGTMSG program.

  //BDMMDUMP DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.OLD.MSGDUMP


Work Files:

  There are three work files necessary to be allocated:

            LRECL   PURPOSE
            -----   -------
BDMMREAD -   12     All Userids to be loaded, and number of messages
                    associated with each of them (in BINARY fullword).

BDMUIDWK -   17     All Userids in the BRODCAST Dataset to be loaded.
                    together with the starting and ending RBA of their
                    messages, and the RBA and slot of their BRODCAST
                    Datatset records.  (Copied to Incore Table later).

BDMFRMAP -    7     Map of Free Userid Records in the entire BRODCAST
                    Dataset.  Key X'FF' together with this record's
                    RBA, and the next free record's RBA.

  You can code the JCL for these three work files as follows:

//* ------  WORK FILES - BELOW ------- *
//BDMMREAD DD DISP=(NEW,PASS),
//            DSN=&&MREAD,UNIT=SYSALLDA,
//            DCB=(DSORG=PS,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=12000,LRECL=12),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(5,5),RLSE)
//BDMUIDWK DD DISP=(NEW,PASS),
//            DSN=&&UIDWK,UNIT=SYSALLDA,
//            DCB=(DSORG=PS,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=17000,LRECL=17),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(5,5),RLSE)
//BDMFRMAP DD DISP=(NEW,PASS),
//            DSN=&&FRMAP,UNIT=SYSALLDA,
//            DCB=(DSORG=PS,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=7000,LRECL=7),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(5,5),RLSE)
//* ------  WORK FILES - ABOVE ------- *

SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the report showing
           everything that was done in the message loading process
           and its preliminary preparations.  Parts of a sample
           report follow:

Program Logic
------- -----

  The Messages that were dumped and which are in the BDMMDUMP file,
are classified under their respective userids in the following form:

./--- UID0001
   message content, etc.
   message content, etc.
./--- UID0002
   message content, etc.
   message content, etc.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  and so forth for all the Userids dumped.

To figure out how to load these messages into a new BRODCAST Dataset,
the following steps are taken:

1.  Read through the entire BDMMDUMP file sequentially, and create
    the BDMMREAD work file, containing each Userid and the number
    of messages under it.

2.  Run through all the Userids in the target BRODCAST Dataset and
    create the BDMUIDWK work file, containing the locations of each
    Userid record, and whether (or not) it already contains messages.
    Create an incore copy of the UIDWK file.

3.  Read the entire target BRODCAST Dataset in sequential order from
    the beginning, and produce a Free Space map containing all empty
    Free Message records, each one's own RBA, and the next Free
    record's RBA.

With this preparation, a preliminary scan is done to determing which
Userids in the BDMMDUMP file have corresponding Userids in the target
BRODCAST Dataset.  If the Userid in the target BRODCAST Dataset
already has messages, then no messages are eligible to be further
loaded, because at this point, we don't want to make any decisions
about whether new messages should go after (or before) old ones, etc.
All eligible messages from all eligible Userids are then totaled and
compared to the total number of free Message records.  If there is
enough room to write the eligible messages, then the message loading
process proceeds.

All User messages for each Userid are then written into all the Free
Space record RBA's directly, in one WRITE.  The chaining is automatic,
because the BDMFRMAP record also contains the next Free Record's RBA.
Then after each Userid's messages have been loaded, the Userid record
from the BDMUIDWK file is looked up, and that Userid's slot is updated
with the correct Beginning and Ending RBA for that Userid.  Finally
the Free Search Record is properly updated.  Then we go to the next
Userid in the BDMMDUMP file, until all Userids which are eligible,
have had all their messages loaded into the new BRODCAST Dataset.

All messages for one Userid are loaded in ascending RBA order, because
the loading goes according to the Free Space Map.  Therefore, loading
the messages using BDMMLOAD has a "reorg-ing" effect, to condense the
reloaded messages into the smallest possible space.


Error Handling:

  DD Name Protection
  -- ---- ----------

  If there are any missing DD names from the JCL, the program informs
you of the situation, provided that the SYSPRINT DD is present.  In
such a case, you will see any or all of the following messages in the
SYSPRINT report:

BDMML01E   ---  BDMUIDWK DD Name Missing  ---
BDMML01E   ---  BDMFRMAP DD Name Missing  ---

BDMML05E   ***  Please correct your JCL   ***

  If SYSPRINT is present a Return Code of 12 is issued.

  If SYSPRINT is NOT present, then messages about the missing DD Names
are written to the JOB LOG, as follows (as many messages as apply):

 BDMML00I     ----------------------------
 BDMML10E     SYSPRINT DD Name is missing...

  If SYSPRINT is not present, a Return Code of 16 is issued, to
indicate the extra severity.

  Return Codes and their Relevant Circumstances
  ------ ----- --- ----- -------- -------------

Return Code = 4 :

  The Preliminary Scan determined that no messages from BDMMDUMP
  were eligible to be loaded.


Return Code = 8 :

  The Preliminary Scan determined that there were not enough Free
  Message Records in the BRODCAST Dataset to accommodate the number
  of eligible messages to be loaded.


Return Code = 12 :

  Missing DD Names, but the SYSPRINT DD is present.


Return Code = 16 :

  Missing DD Names, and the SYSPRINT DD is absent.
