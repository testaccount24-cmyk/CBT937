 BDMNXPRT -  Export all of the Global Notices in a BRODCAST
             Dataset, to an EXPORT file in BDMNOTFY format.
             Since the EXPORT file is intended to be executed
             as a CLIST, PROC 0 and CONTROL ASIS (for preserving
             lowercase characters) are put in at the beginning,
             preceding the generated BDMNOTFY statements.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMNXPRT program is used to EXPORT all of the Global Notify
Messages from a BRODCAST Dataset into an external file, in BDMNOTFY
format, so they can be reloaded into a new BRODCAST Dataset.

  Operation is similar to the BDMNLIST program, except that the
output file is produced and written to the EXPORT DD name.

  The EXPORT DD name must be a Variable Blocked file of LRECL=255.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMNXPRT program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMNXPRT program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMNXPRT as a TSO command.
And you can capture the outputs using the TSOE, TSOB, or TSOV REXXes
that are in the CLIST library (from Mark Zelden).

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset

  You must also define a Variable Blocked File with an LRECL of 255
to receive the Exported Records, as output of the BDMNXPRT command.

ALLOC F(EXPORT) DA(EXPORT.DATA) SPACE(5 45) TRACKS RECFM(V B) -
    LRECL(255) UNIT(SYSDA) REUSE

or

//EXPORT    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.EXPORT.dataset,
//              DCB=(DSORG=PS,RECFM=VB,LRECL=255,BLKSIZE=6000),
//              UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,(5,45),RLSE)

Report:
------

  If you issue the BDMNXPRT command against a BRODCAST Dataset,
  you will get output that is similar to that of the BDMNLIST
  command, as follows:

Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic are similar to those
of the BDMNLIST program, except that an extra output file is written
to the EXPORT DD name, in BDMNOTFY format, and prefixed by:

PROC 0
CONTROL ASIS          (to preserve lowercase characters)

  This output file may be used as CLIST input to reload all of the
Global Notify messages that were dumped, into another BRODCAST
Dataset.

  The messages are surrounded by "open curly bracket" and "close
curly bracket", so that enclosed special characters are preserved,
and the proper message length is loaded into the new BRODCAST Dataset.


Error Handling:
----- --------


  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMNXPRT issues
the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        Bad Open - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the EXPORT DD allocation is missing, then BDMNXPRT issues
the following message:

 IEC130I EXPORT   DD STATEMENT MISSING
     BAD OPEN - ALLOC F(EXPORT) DA(EXPORT.DATA) SPACE(5 45) TRACKS RECFM(V B) -
          LRECL(255) UNIT(SYSDA) REUSE

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *
