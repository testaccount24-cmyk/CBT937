 BDMREST  -  Restore the dumped BRODCAST Dataset records which
             were created by the BDMDUMP program, and which are
             in a Sequential Format, non-keyed blocked file, into
             a Direct Access (DSORG=DA) properly formatted new
             BRODCAST Dataset, which is properly keyed also, and
             unblocked.  Special adjustment has to be made to the
             empty User Message Records, which must contain their
             relative position on the track, in their first data
             byte.  This is automatically adjusted by the BDMREST
             Restore program.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  See also, the description of the BDMEXPND program, and consider
using that program, if you need to.

  The BDMREST program reloads a DSORG=DA database, which is the keyed
BRODCAST Dataset, from records that were previously sequentialized
from an existing BRODCAST Dataset, by the BDMDUMP program.

  If end-of-extent occurs prematurely, then the number of records
actually written is reported, and an allocation recommendation is
made, as to how many tracks you have to allocate in the PRIMARY
extent.

  Only the number of records originally dumped, is restored by the
BDMREST program.  In other words, BDMREST cannot make the original
BRODCAST Dataset larger.  But our other program, BDMEXPND, makes
the BRODCAST Dataset larger, filling all PRIMARY allocated space
with empty User Message Records.

  Depending on your needs, you should consider which program to use.
There is another path too.  This may seem complicated, but it can be
set up in a batch job, and its normal running time, for an average
sized BRODCAST Dataset, should be less than two minutes.  The approach
is as follows:

  You might make a completely new BRODCAST Dataset using the BDMINIT
program, which allows adjustments of all sizes, and numbers of
records, using SYSIN cards to control the numbers of each type of
record.  Then you can dump the Userids from the old BRODCAST Dataset
using the BDMGTUID program, sorting them using BDMUSORT, and you
reload them using BDMULOAD.  Next, for the User Messages, you can dump
them using the BDMGTMSG program, and reload them into the new BRODCAST
Dataset using the BDMMLOAD (fast message loader) program.  Once set
up, this method can make you a brand new BRODCAST Dataset which is
completely reorganized, and do it in very fast time.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  The BDMREST program, is a relatively simple program that restores
a DSORG=DA database from an DSORG=PS sequential backup.  Three DD
names are required.  The BRODDUMP DD name contains the backup.  The
BRODCAST DD name allocates the newly restored BRODCAST Dataset, and
the SYSPRINT DD name contains the report of results.

  Required DD names -

BRODCAST - This is the BRODCAST Dataset that is being restored.

      Sample JCL definition for the new BRODCAST dataset.

  //BRODCAST DD  DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.BRODCAST,DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
  //         DCB=(DSORG=DA,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=129,KEYLEN=1,LRECL=129),
  //         SPACE=(TRK,(300,30),RLSE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=WORK05

BRODDUMP - This is the FB-130 dataset that contains the dumped
           records from BRODCAST.

      Sample JCL definition for BRODDUMP DD name.

  //BRODDUMP DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.DUMP.NEW.BRODCAST

SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the report showing
           the success or failure of the Restore process.

 ---   BDMREST    ---   BRODCAST Dataset Restore Program   ---


                This program creates a copy of the BRODCAST
                dataset from a BDMDUMP file, which had originally
                been created from a BRODCAST dataset or a copy.
                The restored dataset must reside in one extent.
                This program can restore BRODCAST across device
                types of different geometry, and will report on
                how many tracks exactly, should be used for the
                allocation of the output dataset.


      Expected Number of Records in Copy, from Header :        9750
      Number of Records Actually Loaded into the Copy :        9750
      Number of Records per Track for this Device Type:          50
      Expected Number of Tracks to be Allocated       :         195

        Loading Action Completed Successfully .


Program Logic:
------- -----

  The BDMREST program takes advantage of the BSAM technique for
loading a direct access dataset initially, called MACRF=WL.  The
WRITE operation returns a return code of 4 at end-of-track, and 8
at end-of-extent.

  If end-of-extent occurs prematurely, then the number of records
actually written is reported, and an allocation recommendation is
made, as to how many tracks you have to allocate in the PRIMARY
extent.

  Only the number of records originally dumped, is restored by the
BDMREST program.  In other words, BDMREST cannot make the original
BRODCAST Dataset larger.  But our other program, BDMEXPND, makes
the BRODCAST Dataset larger, filling all PRIMARY allocated space
with empty User Message Records.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  If the PRIMARY allocation for the newly loaded BRODCAST DD name
is too small, the SYSPRINT report shows the following information,
of which we present a sample:

    Expected Number of Records in Copy, from Header :        9750
    Number of Records Actually Loaded into the Copy :        9650
    Number of Records per Track for this Device Type:          50
    Expected Number of Tracks to be Allocated       :         195

    Loading Interrupted Unexpectedly....
    Please rerun, and allocate          195   tracks
     in a single extent.

    WARNING - Output BRODCAST dataset is not usable !
