 BDMEXPND -  Restore the dumped BRODCAST Dataset records which
             were created by the BDMDUMP program, and which are
             in a Sequential Format, non-keyed blocked file, into
             a Direct Access (DSORG=DA) properly formatted new
             BRODCAST Dataset, which is properly keyed also, and
             unblocked.  Special adjustment has to be made to the
             empty User Message Records, which must contain their
             relative position on the track, in their first data
             byte.  This is automatically adjusted by the BDMEXPND
             Restore program.  The BDMEXPND program can make the
             restored BRODCAST Dataset larger, and will fill its
             entire PRIMARY allocated extent, with empty User
             Message Records.


Execution Mode:   Batch Program
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  See also, the description of the BDMREST program, and consider
using that program, if you need to keep the old BRODCAST Dataset
size.

  The BDMEXPND program reloads a DSORG=DA database, which is the keyed
BRODCAST Dataset, from records that were previously sequentialized
from an existing BRODCAST Dataset, using the BDMDUMP program.

  If end-of-extent occurs prematurely, then the number of records
actually written is reported, and an allocation recommendation is
made, as to how many tracks you have to allocate in the PRIMARY
extent.

  If more PRIMARY space is allocated, than the minimum needed for
the restore of the old BRODCAST Dataset's records, BDMEXPND will
add more empty User Message Records to the end of the new BRODCAST
Dataset, until the entire allocated PRIMARY extent is completely
filled.

  Depending on your needs, you should consider which program to use.
If you do not want to expand your restored BRODCAST Dataset, you
should use the BDMREST program.  If you want to make the restored
BRODCAST Dataset bigger, you should use the BDMEXPND program.

  There is another path too.  This may seem complicated, but it can
be set up in a batch job, and its normal running time, for an average
sized BRODCAST Dataset, should be less than two minutes.  The
approach is as follows:

  You might make a completely new BRODCAST Dataset using the BDMINIT
program, which allows adjustments of all sizes, and numbers of
records, using SYSIN cards to control the numbers of each type of
record.  Then you can dump the Userids from the old BRODCAST Dataset
using the BDMGTUID program, sorting them using BDMUSORT, and you
reload them using BDMULOAD.  Next, for the User Messages, you can dump
them using the BDMGTMSG program, and reload them into the new BRODCAST
Dataset using the BDMMLOAD (fast message loader) program.  Once set
up, this method can make you a brand new BRODCAST Dataset which is
completely reorganized, and do it in very fast time.


JCL Requirements:
--- ------------

  The BDMEXPND program, is a relatively simple program that restores
a DSORG=DA database from an DSORG=PS sequential backup.  Three DD
names are required.  The BRODDUMP DD name contains the backup.  The
BRODCAST DD name allocates the newly restored BRODCAST Dataset, and
the SYSPRINT DD name contains the report of results.

  Required DD names -

BRODCAST - This is the BRODCAST Dataset that is being restored.

      Sample JCL definition for the new BRODCAST dataset.

  //BRODCAST DD  DSN=SBGOLOB.NEW.BRODCAST,DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
  //         DCB=(DSORG=DA,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=129,KEYLEN=1,LRECL=129),
  //         SPACE=(TRK,(300,30),RLSE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=WORK05

BRODDUMP - This is the FB-130 dataset that contains the dumped
           records from BRODCAST.

      Sample JCL definition for BRODDUMP DD name.

  //BRODDUMP DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SBGOLOB.DUMP.NEW.BRODCAST

SYSPRINT - A SYSOUT DD name which contains the report showing
           the success or failure of the Restore process.

 ---   BDMEXPND    ---   BRODCAST Dataset Restore Program  ---


                This program creates a copy of the BRODCAST
                dataset from a BDMDUMP file, which had originally
                been created from a BRODCAST dataset or a copy.
                The restored dataset must reside in one extent.
                This program can restore BRODCAST across device
                types of different geometry, and will report on
                how many tracks exactly, should be used for the
                allocation of the output dataset.


      Expected Number of Records in Copy, from Header :        9750
      Number of Records Actually Loaded into the Copy :       15000
      Number of Records per Track for this Device Type:          50
      Expected Number of Tracks to be Allocated       :         300
      BRODCAST copy expanded successfully.  It now
      contains     15000   records on       300 tracks
      in a single extent.
      Header Record updated successfully.


Program Logic:
------- -----

  The BDMEXPND program takes advantage of the BSAM technique for
loading a direct access dataset initially, called MACRF=WL.  The
WRITE operation returns a return code of 4 at end-of-track, and 8
at end-of-extent.

  If end-of-extent occurs prematurely, then the number of records
actually written is reported, and an allocation recommendation is
made, as to how many tracks you have to allocate in the PRIMARY
extent.

  BDMEXPND fills the PRIMARY allocated space with extra empty User
Message Records, until the PRIMARY allocated space is completely
filled.  Since the header records of a BRODCAST Dataset contains
the total number of records in that BRODCAST Dataset, and the number
is now greater than the number in the original BRODCAST Dataset that
was dumped, the new larger total number of records must be inserted
into the BRODCAST Dataset header, after all records were loaded, and
the actual number is known.  So BDMEXPND makes this adjustment to the
BRODCAST header, and it reports that it was successfully done.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  If the PRIMARY allocation for the newly loaded BRODCAST DD name
is too small, the SYSPRINT report shows the following information,
of which we present a sample:
