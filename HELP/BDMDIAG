 BDMDIAG -   Find all User Messages in the BRODCAST Dataset which
             are not chained to any Userid.  This makes them
             otherwise inaccessible, and therefore they can not
             be deleted by any normal method.  These unattached
             User Messages would clog up the BRODCAST Dataset
             forever (until an ACCOUNT SYNC), if it were not for
             the BDMDIAG DELBAD option, which can (and will)
             delete them.

Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMDIAG program is used find all User Messages that are
"orphaned", or unattached to any Userid.  This might be due to
some corruption of the BRODCAST Dataset.

  How does the BDMDIAG program find such records and root them out?
The method is as follows:

  The BDMDIAG program makes a table of all Key bytes in the BRODCAST
Dataset with Key = X'03', and it then runs all the chains of Userid
Messages, changing the X'03' entries in the table to something else,
if that corresponding message was hit by running a Userid chain.  All
the X'03' messages that are left over afterward must (of necessity) be
not attached to any Userid, and therefore, they are the "orphaned"
messages that we are looking for.

  Once the BDMDIAG has found the orphaned User Messages, it has a
choice, whether to keep them or to delete them.  If you run BDMDIAG
with the REPORT keyword, then BDMDIAG keeps the messages unchanged.
But if you run BDMDIAG with the DELBAD option, it converts all the
orphaned messages into empty User Messages, with Key = X'FF' and first
data byte equal to the "R" of the "TTR" or "CCHHR".  That "R" is the
position of the record in the track.  So the orphaned messages are
therefore converted into (subsequently usable) empty User Messages.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMDIAG program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMDIAG program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMDIAG as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to look
at for orphaned records, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name,
as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset

Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were mentioned above,
in the "Description of Operation" section.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  BDMDIAG responds to any keyword entry errors, by telling you what
the correct options are.  The BDMDIAG program always produces the
following instructions in all of its reports:

          BDMDIAG   -  Valid Execution Parms are :
          BDMDIAG REPORT - Report orphaned USER messages
          BDMDIAG DELBAD - Delete orphaned USER messages
