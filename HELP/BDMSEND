 BDMSEND -   SEND a User Message to a particular BRODCAST Dataset,
             not necessarily the Active BRODCAST Dataset in the
             system.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMSEND program is used to SEND a User Message to a particular
BRODCAST Dataset, in which that Userid is defined.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMSEND program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMSEND program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMSEND as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset

Report:
------

  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER has one sample message
  and we issue:

  BDMSEND USR1247 This is my message.

    And the resulting reply is:

  This is my message.
  MESSAGE SENT TO USERID: USR1247


Program Logic:
------- -----

  BDMSEND parses, first for the Userid that the message is to be sent
to, and after a space, the Message is parsed and is expected to extend
to the end of the command buffer.  If you want to include spaces,







Error Handling:
----- --------

  BDMSEND checks the entered Userid (the first positional keyword)
and runs the chain of Userid records to see if this Userid is there.
If it is not, the following message is issued:

 YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY A USERID AFTER THE COMMAND NAME

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  BDMSEND checks if a message is sent after the Userid Name.  If
there is no second parameter, containing message text, BDMSEND issues
the following message:

 YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY MESSAGE TEXT AFTER THE USERID

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If a Userid is entered, that is not defined as a Userid in the
BRODCAST Dataset, then BDMSEND issues the following message:

 * - - NO USERID RECORD FOR USER USR1247  - - *

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, and BDMSEND syntax is
otherwise correct, then BDMSEND issues the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        BAD OPEN - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU
