 BDMLIST -   List SOME, or ALL of the User Messages belonging
             to a given Userid which is defined in the BRODCAST
             Dataset.

 BDMLRBA -   Same as BDMLIST, except that the RBA of each User
             Message is printed before the User Message itself,
             similarly to the way BDMDEL shows the RBA of each
             message deleted.  Therefore BDMLRBA can be used
             for diagnosis purposes.

Please refer to the BDMLIST command for information about BDMLRBA.
