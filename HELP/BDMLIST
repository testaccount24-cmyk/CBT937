 BDMLIST -   List SOME, or ALL of the User Messages belonging
             to a given Userid which is defined in the BRODCAST
             Dataset.

 BDMLRBA -   Same as BDMLIST, except that the RBA of each User
             Message is printed before the User Message itself,
             similarly to the way BDMDEL shows the RBA of each
             message deleted.  Therefore BDMLRBA can be used
             for diagnosis purposes.

Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMLIST program is used to LIST all, or some, of the User
Messages which belong to a given Userid.  This is done by accessing
the Userid Record in the Userid Directory, and starting from the
beginning Userid Message in the chain, running through the chain and
printing all the records in the chain.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMLIST program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMLIST program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMLIST as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:
-----------
            INSTRUCTIONS FOR BDMLIST TSO COMMAND
            ------------ --- ------ --- -------
      BDMLIST userid                       - List all messages
                                             for one userid.
      BDMLIST userid  SKIP(mm)  MSGS(nn)   - List nn messages
                                             for one userid, after
                                             skipping the first mm
                                             messages.
      BDMLIST ALL$#@                       - List all messages
                                             for all userids defined
                                             in the BRODCAST dataset.

Report:
------

  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER has one sample message
  and we issue:  BDMLIST IBMUSER

  Sample User message.....
  User IBMUSER has       1   Deferred TSO Messages
  * - - - - End of Messages for this User - - - - *

---------------------------------------------------------------

  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER has one sample message
  and we issue:  BDMLRBA IBMUSER

  0002C7 Sample User message.....
  User IBMUSER has       1   Deferred TSO Messages
  * - - - - End of Messages for this User - - - - *

---------------------------------------------------------------

  Explanation:  The 0002C7 number is the Hex representation of
         the RBA of the BRODCAST record which the message had
         occupied.

         Sample User message.....
         is the actual message text.

         User IBMUSER has       1   Deferred TSO Messages
         tells you how many messages the Userid had before the
         deletion.


  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER had three sample message
  and we issue:  BDMLIST IBMUSER SKIP(1) MSGS(1)

  Number of MSGS to Skip           1
  Limit  of MSGS to List           1
  Sample user message 2
  User IBMUSER has       3   Deferred TSO Messages
  * - - - - End of Messages for this User - - - - *

  so Userid IBMUSER has three messages, but the first, and the
  third were skipped from the list.  The first, because of the
  SKIP(1) keyword, and the third, because of the MSGS(1) keyword
  that limits the listing to 1 message.


Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were mentioned above,
in the "Description of Operation" section.

Error Handling:
----- --------

  BDMLIST checks the entered Userid (the first positional keyword)
and runs the chain of Userid records to see if this Userid is there.
If it is not, the following message is issued:

 * - - No USERID Record for User USER134  - - *

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMLIST issues
the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        Bad Open - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If no userid was entered after the BDMLIST command then BDMLIST
returns the reply:

        Please enter the USERID name after Command name

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the values entered into the SKIP(mm) or MSGS(nn) are not
numeric, then the non-numeric character entered is replaced by
an asterisk (to make the error more visible), and the following
messages are displayed:

 Limit  of MSGS to Delete  *888*4       Non-Numeric
 Number of MSGS to Skip    *99*6        Non-Numeric

 MSGS or SKIP keyword values were non-numeric.
 No User Messages have been deleted.

   Return Code = 8
