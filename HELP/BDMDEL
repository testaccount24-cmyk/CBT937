 BDMDEL  -   Delete SOME, or ALL of the User Messages belonging
             to a given Userid which is defined in the BRODCAST
             Dataset.

Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMDEL program is used to DELETE all, or some, of the User
Messages which belong to a given Userid.  This is done by accessing
the Userid Record in the Userid Directory, and starting from the
beginning Userid Message in the chain, running through the chain and
printing and deleting all the records in the chain.

  There is a difference in the way BDMDEL deletes records and the
way IBM's LISTBC command deletes records.  IBM's LISTBC only changes
the first two bytes of the record.  The key byte X'03' is changed to
X'FF', and the first data byte is changed to the "R" of the "TTR" or
"CCHHR" of the record on the track.  This is the binary number of the
data record on the track.  All the rest of the data from the deleted
message remains, cluttering the BRODCAST Dataset with irrelevant
debris.  BDMDEL does the same "logical deletion" of the record, but
it zeroes out the rest of the record with X'00' bytes.  Therefore the
deleted record looks clean, and different from an occupied message
record.

  After the deletion, the Free Search Record is examined, and if the
RBA of the newly deleted record is less than the one pointed to by the
Free Search Record, the lower RBA of the new deleted record is inserted
into the Free Search Record instead of what was previously there.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMDEL program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMDEL program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMDEL as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:

            INSTRUCTIONS FOR BDMDEL TSO COMMAND
            ------------ --- ------ --- -------
      BDMDEL  userid                       - Delete all messages
                                             for one userid.
      BDMDEL  userid  SKIP(mm)  MSGS(nn)   - Delete nn messages
                                             for one userid, after
                                             skipping the first mm
                                             messages.
      BDMDEL  ALL$#@                       - Delete all messages
                                             for all userids defined
                                             in the BRODCAST dataset.

Report:
------

  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER had one sample message
  and we issue:  BDMDEL IBMUSER

  0002C7 Sample User message.....
         User IBMUSER had       1   Deferred TSO Messages
         * - - - - End of Messages for this User - - - - *

  Explanation:  The 0002C7 number is the Hex representation of
         the RBA of the BRODCAST record which the message had
         occupied.

                Sample User message.....
         is the actual message text.

                User IBMUSER had       1   Deferred TSO Messages
         tells you how many messages the Userid had before the
         deletion.


  Here is what you see if Userid IBMUSER had three sample message
  and we issue:  BDMDEL IBMUSER SKIP(1) MSGS(1)

  Number of MSGS to Skip           1
  Limit  of MSGS to Delete         1
  0002C8 Sample user message 2
         User IBMUSER had       3   Deferred TSO Messages
         User IBMUSER has       2   Deferred TSO Messages left
         * - - - - End of Messages for this User - - - - *

  so now, Userid IBMUSER has two messages left, the first, and the
  third, of the previous messages which were there.


Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were mentioned above,
in the "Description of Operation" section.

Error Handling:
----- --------

  BDMDEL checks the entered Userid (the first positional keyword)
and runs the chain of Userid records to see if this Userid is there.
If it is not, the following message is issued:

 * - - No USERID Record for User USER134  - - *

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMDEL issues
the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        Bad Open - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If no userid was entered after the BDMDEL command then BDMDEL
returns the reply:

        Please enter the USERID name after Command name

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the values entered into the SKIP(mm) or MSGS(nn) are not
numeric, then the non-numeric character entered is replaced by
an asterisk (to make the error more visible), and the following
messages are displayed:

 Limit  of MSGS to Delete  *888*4       Non-Numeric
 Number of MSGS to Skip    *99*6        Non-Numeric

 MSGS or SKIP keyword values were non-numeric.
 No User Messages have been deleted.

   Return Code = 8
