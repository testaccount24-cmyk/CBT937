 BDMUSDEL -  Delete a single Userid from the BRODCAST Dataset, and
             also delete ALL of its attached User Messages.


Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface
--------- ----


Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMUSDEL program is used to delete one Userid from the BRODCAST
Dataset.  If that Userid has attached User Messages, then these are
deleted as well.

  This is how the operation works.  The Userid records in the
BRODCAST Dataset are scanned sequentially from the beginning to
the end, until either of two things happens:

1.  The Userid Name is encountered in the BRODCAST Dataset.

2.  The Userid Name is not encountered, and the end of all the
    Userids in the Userid Records is reached.

  If there is a Userid occurrence, then it is checked to see if any
messages are attached to it.  If any are, the User Message chain is
run, and all the attached messages are zeroed out and converted to
empty User Messages, with key X'FF' and the binary position of the
record on the track, in the first data byte.  The Free Search Record
is adjusted accordingly, if that is needed.

  Then, after that, the Userid Record Slot is zeroed out.

JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMUSDEL program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMUSDEL program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMUSDEL as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to
look at, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name, as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:
-----------
            INSTRUCTIONS FOR BDMUSDEL TSO COMMAND
            ------------ --- -------- --- -------

      BDMUSDEL userid            - Delete this Userid from the
                                   BRODCAST Dataset, and delete
                                   all of its attached messages.

Program Logic:
------- -----

  The basic principles of the program logic were explained above,
in the "Description of Operation" section.


Error Handling:
----- --------

  If no Userid name is added after the BDMUSDEL command, the following
message is issued:

 PLEASE ENTER THE USERID NAME AFTER COMMAND NAME

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the Userid name entered after the command name, does not exist
in the BRODCAST Dataset, then the following message is issued:

 * - - NO USERID RECORD FOR USER USR1247  - - *

* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *

  If the BRODCAST DD allocation is missing, then BDMUSDEL issues
the following message:

 IEC130I BRODCAST DD STATEMENT MISSING
        BAD OPEN - ALLOC F(BRODCAST) DA(SYS1.BRODCAST) SH REU
