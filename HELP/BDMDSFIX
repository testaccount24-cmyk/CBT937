 BDMDSFIX -  Fix a Broadcast Dataset which was copied from a 3380
             disk to a 3390 disk.  Or fix any Broadcast Dataset
             which has a certain error in a free message record.
             The error is as follows:  A free message record in
             the Broadcast Dataset has its one-byte key equal to
             X'FF'.  The first data byte in that record, following
             the key, has to be equal to the "R" (or the record
             number on the track) in the "TTR".  If the first data
             byte is not the "R" of the TTR of the record, havoc
             follows.  This program fixes the first data byte value
             of all X'FF' records in the Broadcast Dataset to the
             "R" value of that record's TTR.

Execution Mode:   TSO Command - using the PUTLINE interface

Description of Operation:
----------- -- ---------

  The BDMDSFIX program fixes the first byte of all X'FF' records
(free message records) to have a value of the "R" in the TTR of
that record.  This value is necessary for the Broadcast Dataset
to function properly.  When you copy a Broadcast Dataset to a disk
of different geometry, the "R" value in the first byte of the free
message records can get messed up.

  For example, a 3380 pack can hold 53 Broadcast records on a track,
which is X'35'.  A 3390 pack can only hold 50 Broadcast records to
a track.  Thus on a 3390 an X'FF' record can't contain a value in
its first data byte bigger than X'32'.  But if the dataset was copied
from a 3380 device, there might be larger values in the first data
byte of the X'FF' records.  All of the first bytes in error, have to
be fixed.

  The program works by reading all Broadcast records in order,
determining the "R" value of each record as we go.  If the "R" number
that was there, is different from what it should be, it is changed.
Otherwise, it is left the same, since that value is correct.


JCL Requirements or TSO Allocations:
--- ------------ -- --- -----------

  The BDMDSFIX program is a TSO command, but it uses the PUTLINE
interface to write its output to the terminal.  Therefore you can
run the BDMDSFIX program under TSO-in-batch, and still see its
output.  You can (of course) also run BDMDSFIX as a TSO command.

Allocation Requirement -

  The particular copy of the BRODCAST dataset which you want to look
at for bad X'FF' records, must be pointed to by the BRODCAST DD name,
as follows:

ALLOC FI(BRODCAST) DA(your.BRODCAST.dataset) SH REUSE

or

//BRODCAST  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.BRODCAST.dataset


Subcommands:   (none)
